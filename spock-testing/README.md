I really like testing with Spock.  It provides more structure without going all
the way to using Cucumber or something like that, and the features of Groovy are
convenient to use while testing.  The first examples I added (FibonacciGroovySpec, 
MockStubGroovyExampleSpec, and ParamterizedFibonacciGroovySpec) are from:
 
<https://dzone.com/articles/junit4-junit5-and-spock-framework-comparison>

Other examples are mostly from the Spock User
Guide at <http://spockframework.org/spock/docs/1.2/index.html>.  I also helped
myself to some examples from talks and what not in the spock github repository
<https://github.com/spockframework>.
